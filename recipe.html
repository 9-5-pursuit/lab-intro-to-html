  <h2>Description</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Mangu is my favorite dish and it can be eaten at any time. Mangu is
    traditionally the Dominican Republic's national breakfast.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 green plantain</li>
    <li>Â¾ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, unsalted</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Peel the plantains and cut lengthwise, then divide each half into two.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the plantains to a pot and boil in enough water to cover them until
      they are very tender. Add salt to the water before the water breaks the
      boil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the plantains from the water and mash them right away with a fork
      until they are very smooth and there are few to no lumps. Mix in butter,
      and water. Keep mashing and mixing until smooth.
    </li>
