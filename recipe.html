      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to
          package directions until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta
          water, and return to pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon 5 minutes.
          Add garlic and cook until bacon is crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Put
          into a bowl and drain half the fat in skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add chicken to skillet and increase heat to medium-high. Season
          generously with salt, pepper and cook, flipping halfway through, until
          no longer pink, 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce heat to low and return bacon to skillet. Toss, then add cooked
          pasta and toss until combined.
        </li>
