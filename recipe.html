    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™ve been devouring a few episodes of John Favreau's, The Chef Show. If
      you enjoy watching food shows on Netflix, this one is for you. In episode
      2 Favreau and friend Chef Roy Choi take you on a journey of grilled
      cheese. Pretty much right in our strike zone for our test kitchen.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 slices bread</li>
      <li>3 slices cheddar yellow</li>
      <li>3 slices cheddar white</li>
      <li>1 oz. gruyere, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 stick butter - unsalted</li>

    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Aggressively butter one side of each slice of bread with your softened
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place one slice of bread, butter side down, on the griddle. Layer the
        top with cheese. Place the other slice butter side down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for about 2 minutes, or until golden and crispy on the bottom and
        cheese softly melted on top. Place second slice on top of cheese. Flip
        with a metal spatula, and cook the second side until equally crispy and
        the cheese is perfectly melty. Remove from the griddle, and enjoy
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
