                <li>1 cup (240ml) homemade or instant dashi(1 pinch of instant dashi and 1 cup water)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) dry sake</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon (15g) sugar, add more for a stronger taste</li>
                <li>1 large onion (about 6 ounces; 170g), thinly sliced</li>
                <li>12 ounces (340g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breast, thinly sliced</li>

            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine dashi, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a 10-inch skillet and bring to a simmer over high heat. Adjust heat to maintain a strong simmer. Stir in onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is half tender, about 5 minutes. Add chicken pieces and cook, stirring and turning chicken occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and broth has reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes for chicken thighs or 3 to 4 minutes for chicken breast.Then add more soy sauce or sugar as desired if the sauce is not already to your taste. The sauce should have a balanced sweet-and-salty flavor.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to a bare simmer. Pour beaten eggs into skillet in a thin, steady stream, holding chopsticks over edge of bowl to help distribute eggs evenly. Cover and cook until eggs are cooked to desired doneness, about 1 minute for runny eggs or 3 minutes for medium-firm.</li>
                <li>To Serve: Transfer hot rice to a single large bowl or 2 individual serving bowls. Top with egg and chicken mixture, pouring out any excess sauce from the pan over rice. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
